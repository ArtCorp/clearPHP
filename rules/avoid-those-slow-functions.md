| array\_intersect   | Try using array\_intersect\_key, as keys are unique |
| array\_udiff       | Try using array\_diff\_key, as keys are unique |
| array\_uintersect  | Try using array\_intersect\_key, as keys are unique |
| array\_unique      | Use array\_count\_values and array\_keys|
| uasort             | Build the array to use non-u sort|
| uksort             | Build the array to use non-u sort|

| preg_replace       | Replace with str_replace(), for simple replacements |
| array_search       | Replace with array_key_exists() |
| array_shift        | Process the array the other way with array_pop() |
| array_unshift      | Process the array the other way with array_push() |
| strstr             | Use strpos() for simple searches |
| uniqid()           | Always mention entropy (2nd parameter) |
