| array\_udiff       | try using array\_diff\_key, as keys are unique |
| array\_uintersect  | try using array\_intersect\_key, as keys are unique |
| array\_unique      |  array\_count\_values and array\_keys|
| uasort             | Build the array to use non-u sort|

| preg_replace              | replace with str_replace, for simple replacements |
