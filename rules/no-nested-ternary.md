# No Nested Ternary

The ternary operator is a compact version of a `if then else` structure. It is very convenient when the branching is needed but should be inline with the rest of the code.

```php
<?php
print "Result : ".( $success ? 'transaction succeded' : 'transaction failed');
?>
```
Ternary operators may be nested. This degrades very quickly the readability of the code.

```php
<?php
print "Result : ".( $success ? $christmas ? 'transaction success and you get a gift' : 'transaction success' : 'transaction failed');
?>
```

## Rule Details

Ternary operators are fine. Nesting them hurts.
