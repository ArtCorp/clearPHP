# Commented Fallthrough

case in switch structures may be finalized using the break keyword. 

They may also continue in the next case, by letting the execution continue without break. This way, two case are merged in one. This is called fallthough.

Fallthrough is usually rare. In the event they occur, most of them will be empty fallthrough, which are actually several case with the same name. 

Fallthough are OK but needs to be commented so as to highlight their usage.

## Rule Details

This rule require that every `case` statement without a `break` has at least a comment. The following patterns are considered warnings:

```php
<?php
switch (foo) {
    case 'a':
        doSomethingForA();
        break 1;

    case 'b':
        doSomethingForB();
		// no break here, fallthrough to C
    case 'c':
        doSomethingForC();
        break 1;

    default:
        // do nothing
}

switch (foo) {
    case 'a':
        doSomethingForA();
        break 1;

    case 'b':
        doSomethingForB();
		// no break here, fallthrough to default

    default:
        doSomethingForDefault();
}

?>
```

The following code is considered legit : 

```php
<?php
switch (foo) {
    case 'a':
    case 'c':
        doSomethingForA();
        // will also do for c
        break 1;

    case 'b':
        doSomethingForB();
        break 1;

    default:
        doSomethingForDefault();
}
?>
```

## When Not To Use It

If default is not always necessary, you may disable this rule.
