# break
`break` ends execution of the current for, foreach, while, do-while or switch structure.

# case
The `case` statement represents one option in a `switch` instruction.

# continue
`continue` is used within looping structures to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and continue execution at the condition evaluation and then the beginning of the next iteration.

# default
The `default` statement represents a catch-all `case` in a `switch` instruction.

# switch
The `switch` statement is similar to a series of IF statements on the same expression. In many occasions, you may want to compare the same variable (or expression) with many different values, and execute a different piece of code depending on which value it equals to. This is exactly what the switch statement is for.
